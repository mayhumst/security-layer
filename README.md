# security-layer

This project utilizes the Repy_V2 sandbox environment found [here](https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/docs/blob/master/Programming/RepyV2Tutorial.md) to create a security layer to enhance the security of basic repy functions. This project was completed for the Computer Security / ISP class in the NYU cybersecurity department Fall 2023. 

This project was threefold -- develop a security layer, write a series of tests to ensure its integrity (and test classmates' layers), and then refine the security layer to patch bugs.
